NAME
    RTx::EmailCompletion - Auto completion for email field

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of RTx::EmailCompletion

DESCRIPTION
    I'm so tired to type email address by hand that I've done this module
    try Add ajax autocompletion on email field

    There's 3 things :

    *   a small web service "html/Ajax/Email" which search in all known
        users in the database

    *   the scriptaculous library to autocomplete

    *   and modified html RT pages to use those two first component

    As I've embedded some pages of RT, it should work only for release
    3.6.3. But I keep the patches of all modified files in "patches/" so you
    can try to use them against other release.

INSTALLATION
    Install it like a standard perl module

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install
